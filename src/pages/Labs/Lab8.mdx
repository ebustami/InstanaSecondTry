In this lab, we will change the name of one of the Ratings Service's endpoints.

## Step 1:

Using the Instana UI, bring up the dashboard for your new rs-ratings-(your last name)service.

Then, Navigate to the Endpoints tab.

Click on the Configure Endpoints link.

## Step 3:

Enter the following in the Custom HTTP Rule field:

```

Feel free to use the Rule tester (copy an actual call from the data to the tester to verify the rule is working correctly).

Then, select save.
